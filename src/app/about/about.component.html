                        I’m an South-Korean designer living and working in Seoul and Daejeon. Currently I’m working as a designer role in IDIM lab. 
                        Until recently, I was studying for master degree in Industrial design.

                        I’m interested in how design can embrace constantly advancing techonologies as well as complicated human behaviors, and solve problems we face today in our everyay lives. Thereby I hope to inspire and enable the people who use and interact with the results of my design.

                        Outside work, I’m interviewing a bunch of interesting people, making visual graphic posters, sketching other beautiful products and working out in the gym. I can also play some drum too.
